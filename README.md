# Simplest Node HTTP server

## Reason to have it

The mean to create this repository was to show @ [Cherry-Pick Porto 2016](http://cherrypick.nei-isep.org/) audience how NodeJS can be so simple.

## Contributing

I am pretty sure no one is going to use this respository, but I dare you to make it even more simple.
